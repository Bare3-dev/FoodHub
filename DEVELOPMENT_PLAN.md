# FoodHub Laravel API Development Plan

## Objective
Develop the complete backend API for the FoodHub application using Laravel 11 and PHP 8.2+. The API should serve as the central hub for all business logic, data management, and integrations, supporting the various frontend applications (web dashboard, customer mobile app, driver mobile app).

## Instructions for Development
Process the development sprints sequentially. For each sprint, generate the requested output (text for planning, code for implementation) and then await explicit instructions to move to the next sprint. Do NOT proceed to the next sprint until explicitly prompted.
